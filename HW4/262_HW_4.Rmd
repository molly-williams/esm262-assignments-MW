### Background

Create a function that calculates the following:

- most frequently caught fish in each location
- total revenue for each location
- total fisheries revenue sum
- graph of revenue by location and total revenue (as text)


### Load data tables for fish prices and catch by location
```{r}

fish_catch <- read_csv("fish_catch.csv")
fish_prices <- read_csv("fish_prices.csv")

# Created these in excel using random numbers
```


### Create function 

```{r}

# Source the R file that contains function auto() and includes all of the pre-set parameters for calculating vehicle power
source("fish_function.R")


```

#run function 

```{r}

graph_output <- calc_fish_revenue(l = fish_catch, p = fish_prices, graph_result = TRUE)

graph_output

no_graph_output <- calc_fish_revenue(l = fish_catch, p = fish_prices, graph_result = FALSE)

no_graph_output
```
