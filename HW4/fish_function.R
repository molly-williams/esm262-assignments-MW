#' Fish function
#' @title Fish Revenue Calculation Function 
#' @description This function determines most frequently caught fish and total revenue by location, and the total revenue for all values.
#' @param l count and type of fish at each location
#' @param p fish price by type
#' @param graph_result if TRUE, output a graphical representation of total fisheries revenue for each site based on type and fish catch count. Defaule = FALSE
#' @return most frequently caught fish species, total revenue by location and in total, total fisheries revenue sum for all location, graph if graph = TRUE
